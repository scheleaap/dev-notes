Rule 1: If you are sick for 3 or more official working days, you must get a sick note on the 3rd day.

Rule 2: If you are sick for 2 or more official working days with at least 1 official non-working day in between, then you must get a sick note on the 2nd official working day.

Official working days are Monday-Friday, unless the day is a public holiday (e.g. Christmas). Both rules apply even if you normally do not work on one of these official working days (i.e. if you work part-time).

Examples:
* If you work Monday-Friday (5 days/week) and are sick from Monday-Wednesday, you must get a sick note on Wednesday (Rule 1).
* If you work Monday-Wednesday and Friday (4 days/week) and are sick from Wednesday-Friday, you must get a sick note on Friday (Rule 1).
* If you are sick from Friday-Monday, you must get a sick note on Monday (Rule 2).
* If you are sick from Saturday-Monday (healthy on Tuesday), you *do not* need a sick note (only 1 German working day).
* If you are sick from Friday-Sunday (healthy on Monday), you *do not* need a sick note (only 1 German working day).
* If you work Monday-Friday (5 days/week) and Thursday is a public holiday (e.g. Himmelfahrt) and you are sick from Wednesday-Friday, you must get a sick note on Friday (Rule 2).
